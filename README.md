# EmpoSeats Rails App

This is a rewrite of the PHP application behind emposeats.com in Ruby on Rails.

A lot of the markup, CSS and JS are original (old), this was mainly an exercise in building on Rails. I also used the old site's existing database schema, otherwise I would have done some things differently.
